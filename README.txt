  Yuxie Xiao -> Minimax Implementation
  
Using minimax decision tree, our AI decides the move it takes against the opponent. Efficiency in constructing the tree is improved using Alpha-Beta Pruning. The depth of the decision tree is set to 4 to limit the time spend on building the decision tree while obtaining sufficient prediction into the next moves. Compiler Optimization is chosen to be the tag "-O3".
